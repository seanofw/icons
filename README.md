Sean's Dialog Icons
===================

**Version 1.0**

This image collection contains a handful of images that I've needed for
a long time when making dialog boxes and other UI components.  I've been
disappointed at the lack of high-quality, free, legally-unencumbered
dialog images for a long time, so finally I broke down and drew my own.

The current version of this collection contains only four images, but
they are each available in many different forms.  Each is transparent,
with an alpha channel that has correctly-paired RGB values so as to avoid
"color ghosting" if you resample them.  Each image is also available in
every power-of-two and power-of-two-times-three size from 16 to 256
pixels square, so they are included at 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192,
256, 384, and 512-pixel sizes, respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The four images available in the current version are:

- ![image](error-24.png) **Error** - _white X on a red circle_
- ![image](warning-24.png) **Warning** - _black ! on a yellow triangle_
- ![image](question-24.png) **Question** - _A white ? on a blue circle_
- ![image](success-24.png) **Success** - _A green checkmark on a white circle_

These images are in the PUBLIC DOMAIN (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)),
which means you can do anything you want with them, as long as you leave
me out of it.

The latest version of this image collection may be downloaded for free
from my GitHub account, at https://github.com/seanofw/icons .  (So if
you paid money for these, you were ripped off!)

I drew these and am giving them away freely because I've been
disappointed at the lack of good-quality, free, legally-unencumbered
UI images out there in the wild.  If you like them and find a use for
them, please feel free to drop me a line at <sean AT werkema D0T com>
and let me know what you used them for.  If you think additional
images ought to be added, or something needs to be changed, feel free
to suggest your revisions or additions in the official repository at
https://github.com/seanofw/icons/issues .
